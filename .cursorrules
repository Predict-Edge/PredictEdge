# Gold Price Prediction Project Rules

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.10+
- TensorFlow/Keras for LSTM
- pandas, numpy for data processing
- yfinance for market data
- matplotlib, seaborn, plotly for viz

## Code Style
- Follow PEP 8
- Use meaningful variable names (no x, y, df1, df2)
- Add comments for complex logic
- Type hints for functions

## Data Science Specific
- Always check data shape and types
- Visualize before and after transformations
- Use chronological splits (never random for time series)
- Scale features before LSTM
- Save models and preprocessed data
- Document assumptions in markdown

## Notebook Structure
Each section must have:
1. Markdown header explaining goal
2. Code with inline comments
3. Validation prints/displays
4. Visualization if applicable
